# About Me
I am a person passionate about problem-solving and always in search of new challenges that take me out of my comfort zone. I enjoy constant learning and love embarking on adventures that broaden my horizons. With an interdisciplinary mindset, I am interested in acquiring knowledge from various areas, as I strongly believe in the feedback among them to enrich my perspective and skills. I identify with the philosophy of "being like water", which allows me to adapt and flow in any situation, making the most of every opportunity and experience that comes my way.

## Work Methodology
I am familiar with a wide variety of work methodologies, both agile and traditional, which allows me to adapt to different environments and teams. Some of the methodologies I have worked with include:
- Agile Methodologies:
    - Scrum
    - Kanban
    - Lean
    - Extreme Programming (XP)
    - Agile Unified Process (AUP)
- Traditional Methodologies:
    - Waterfall
    - Iterative Development
    - Rational Unified Process (RUP)
    - V-Model
      
Additionally, I have had experience in various types of organizational structures, which helps me understand and collaborate effectively in teams with different dynamics and work approaches.
